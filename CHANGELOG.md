# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Audit TSCII byte assignments, add missing symbols and Grantha forms, and fix repeated HA byte corruption.

- Add strict bounded Unicode to TSCII byte encoding and cross-runtime bindings.

- Add bounded TSCII byte decoding, shared fixtures, and Python, WASM, and Dart adapters.
- Remove stale generated Python extensions before rebuilding bindings.

- Add shared publishing policy checks, reusable source/digest gates, and
  serialized manual uploads for future releases.
- Resolve distribution source once across platforms; run the expensive
  artifact matrix on explicit dispatch.
- Document feature development, release preparation, and durable agent handoff.
- Use numbered workspace pytest temp runs for reliable Windows reruns.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 / Python 0.1.0a1 - 2026-10-31

- First experimental MIT-licensed release of the Rust modules and umbrella SDK,
  Python native bindings, and Node/browser WASM package.
- Unicode normalization, tailored Ezhuthu segmentation and Mei/Uyir composition.
- Versioned Agara sorting and search keys.
- Bounded TN/SL integer words, exact INR/LKR amounts, fractions, and Gregorian dates.
- Explicit Bamini decoding and strict, round-trip-checked reverse encoding.
- Shared golden corpus with 21,277 cases and seventeen 10,000-case properties.

The module specifications document bounds and linguistic conventions. APIs may
change before stability. Other legacy encodings and the planned grammar,
morphology, dialect, publishing, prosody, and PostgreSQL modules are excluded.
Dart remains a development adapter requiring a host native library.
